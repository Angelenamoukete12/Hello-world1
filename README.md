# Hello-world1
A simple Hello World program.The code print("Hello, World!") is a simple Python program that demonstrates how to display text on the screen. The print() function is built into Python and is used to output information to the console. The string "Hello, World!" inside the parentheses is a sequence of characters that will be printed exactly as written. This program is often the first example given to beginners because it shows how to interact with the user via output.

In Python, strings are enclosed in quotation marks, and anything inside the quotes is considered text. The print() function sends that text to the console, making it visible when the program runs. Running this code in a Python environment will display the message Hello, World! in the terminal or console window.

This program doesn't require any complex logic or syntax, making it ideal for testing whether the Python environment is set up correctly. It also serves as a basic introduction to how Python works and how to use functions. By using print(), you begin to understand the concept of output and how programs communicate with users.

Though simple, the "Hello, World!" program is a critical first step in learning how to write, run, and test Python code. It also introduces you to the idea that programming involves giving instructions to a computer, which then performs actions like displaying messages.
